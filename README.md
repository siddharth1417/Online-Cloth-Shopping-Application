The shop can keep an electronic history of all purchases and transactions. This gives more control over the operations that the company offers. The system can be adapted to a range of shops from simple small ones to big markets. A shop can outsource the function of shipping to another external company or can handle it itself. Project scope also includes financial transactions that call for other third party services like PayPal.
